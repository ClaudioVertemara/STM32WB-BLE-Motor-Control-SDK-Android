The STM32WB-BLE-Motor-Control-SDK-Android is an application created by ST Microelectronics for mobile devices running Android. The app allows a user to connect to a ST Nucleo-WB55 board with a motor attached to it and control the motorâ€™s speed (RPM) and direction through Bluetooth. On connection, the app will request the min & max motor speeds to use as limits and through out the connection it will periodically request the current motor speed every 100ms to display to the user. A live time-log is also available to view the application & Bluetooth activities.

## App User Guide
1. Download the APK and install it on a mobile device running the minimum supported Android version.
    * You may need to change a setting that allows the installation of "unknown apps" to install the APK.
2. On first open, the application will show you an explanation on how to use the app. Tap on skip to skip this if you already know how to use the app.

4. Once scanning has started you will see a list of nearby Bluetooth devices. Tap on a device to attempt a Bluetooth connection.
    * By default, the list is filtered to devices named "MCSDK". Uncheck the checkbox filter at the bottom to see all nearby devices.
5. On successful connection, the motor control becomes accessible and the app will attempt to request the motor speed limits from the connected device.
    * You may also manually set the min/max speed limits by tapping the speed icon on the top left corner.

7. Use the speed slider to set the speed of the motor in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.
    * Get Speed shows you the actual motor speed.
    * Set Speed shows you the speed you set from the slider.
        * Tap the set speed value to manually type in a speed value.
    * Difference will show you the difference between the set speed and actual motor (get) speed.
